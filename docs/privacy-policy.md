# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 2026-02-15

This Privacy Policy explains how **Offline Video Player** (“the app”) handles information when you use it.

## Summary
- The app is designed to work **offline**.
- The app **does not collect** or transmit personal data to any server.
- The app accesses **on-device video files** only to show your library and play videos.
- Playback history (resume position / last played time) is stored **locally on your device**.

## Information We Access
### On-device media (videos)
The app requests permission to read your on-device videos so it can:
- scan your device for video files,
- display them in folders/lists,
- play them.

On Android 13+ this is typically `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO`. On older Android versions it may use `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`.

### Screenshots (optional feature)
If you use the in-player **Screenshot** feature, the app saves an image to your device’s Pictures folder using Android’s media APIs.

On Android 9 and below, Android may require `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` to save screenshots.

## Information We Store
The app stores the following **locally on your device**:
- video resume position (last playback position)
- last played timestamp (for the “Local History” row)

This information stays on your device and is not uploaded by the app.

## Information We Collect / Share
- **Collected:** None
- **Shared with third parties:** None

The app does not include ads SDKs or analytics SDKs.

## Data Security
Because the app does not transmit your data to a server, there is no server-side storage of your information by the app. Standard Android protections apply to the app’s local storage.

## Children’s Privacy
The app does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date will be changed when updates are made.
